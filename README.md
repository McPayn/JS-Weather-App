## How It Works
Using [open-meteo's](https://open-meteo.com) Weather Forecast and Geocoding APIs, this web app will allow you to search for
any city and will provide you with real-time weather information for that location

## Current Features
Currently, the application will only provide you with the first result when searching for a city and it's current temperature

## To-Do
* Create drop-down list in search to allow user to pick from multiple search results
* ~~Implement high/low temps of current day, as well as 7 day forecast~~ DONE
* ~~Implement rain chance for each day~~ DONE
* ~~Add icons that relate to current weather~~ DONE
